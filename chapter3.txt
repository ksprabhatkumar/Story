 Part 3: The Mysterious Departure  

As the sun dipped beneath the horizon on the eve of Thorin's seventy-fifth year, a solemn aura enveloped 
the kingdom. In the presence of his closest confidantes, the king uttered cryptic words that reverberated 
through the court, "To a realm beyond, I shall journey, where shadows whisper truths untold." With those 
enigmatic words, King Thorin vanished from the mortal realm. At dawn, the kingdom awoke to find the 
tomb sealed, vines entwined into an impenetrable barrier. Whispers persisted that Thorin's departure 
marked not an end, but the commencement of an ethereal quest. Some claimed to catch the echo of his 
voice in the rustling wind, carrying secrets of a realm draped in mystery, forever linked with the enigmatic 
tomb guarding the passage between worlds.
